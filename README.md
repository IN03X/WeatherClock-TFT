# WeatherClock-TFT
A repository for my first ESP32 project.

## Software
"clock_weather_led_v1.1": 
```c++
String url = "http://apis.juhe.cn/simpleWeather/query";
String url2 = "http://apis.juhe.cn/simpleWeather/wids";
String city = "南京";
String key = ""; // Set Your APIkey
```
You are supposed to set your own APIKey here.

## Hardware
"Hardware":
Reference for your wiring connection.

## Tips
The code is poorly written because it was written about one years ago and at that time I didn't know how to use interrupt.
I have forgotten this project for almost one year and now I'm trying to bring it to an end!
